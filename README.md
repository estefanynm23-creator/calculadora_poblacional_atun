# Tuna Population Calculator

## Overview
The Tuna Population Calculator is an interactive application designed to model and analyze the population growth of tuna using the Beverton-Holt model. This project aims to provide researchers and biologists with a tool to simulate tuna population dynamics and analyze biological data through numerical curve fitting methods.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly graphical interface for inputting parameters and visualizing population growth.
- **Beverton-Holt Model**: Implements the Beverton-Holt model for predicting future populations based on current data.
- **Numerical Curve Fitting**: Includes methods for accurately fitting biological data to improve model predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates plots to visualize population dynamics over time.
- **Sample Data**: Comes with sample biological data for testing and analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tuna-population-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd tuna-population-calculator
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```
This will launch the interactive calculator where you can input parameters and analyze the tuna population growth.
