# Tuna Population Calculator

## Overview
The Tuna Population Calculator is an interactive application designed to model and analyze the population growth of tuna using the Beverton-Holt model. This project aims to provide researchers and fisheries managers with a tool to simulate tuna populations, analyze biological data, and visualize the results effectively.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to input parameters and visualize population growth.
- **Beverton-Holt Model**: Implements the Beverton-Holt model for estimating future populations based on current data.
- **Numerical Curve Fitting**: Includes methods for fitting biological data accurately and efficiently.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates plots to help users understand population dynamics over time.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation and user guides to assist users in navigating the application.

## Installation
To install the Tuna Population Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tuna-population-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd tuna-population-calculator
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```
This will launch the interactive calculator where you can input parameters for the tuna population model and view the results.
